# CLI Commands

Below are some common command-line interface (CLI) commands:

- `ls`: Lists all files and directories in the current directory. You can also use options like `ls -a` to show hidden files and `ls -l` for a detailed list.

- `cat`: Displays the contents of a file. For example, `cat filename.txt` will output the contents of `filename.txt`.

- `cd`: Changes the current directory. You can move to a different directory by typing `cd directory_name`. Use `cd ..` to move up one level to the parent directory.

- `pwd`: Displays the full path of the current working directory. This is useful for knowing exactly where you are in the file system.
